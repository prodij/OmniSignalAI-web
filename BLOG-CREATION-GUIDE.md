## Phase 1: Content Planning (30-60 minutes)

### Step 1: Keyword Research

**Primary Goal:** Find keywords that both humans search for AND LLMs will cite

**Tools to use:**
1. **Google Keyword Planner** - Find search volume
2. **Answer the Public** - Discover question-based queries
3. **Google Search Console** - Analyze existing traffic
4. **ChatGPT/Claude** - Ask "What questions do people have about [topic]?"

**LLM Citation Strategy:**
- LLMs cite content that provides **clear, factual answers**
- Focus on "How to", "What is", "How long", "How much" queries
- Include specific numbers, timeframes, and comparative data
- Use structured formats (tables, lists, steps)

**Example keyword selection:**
```
Primary: "AI social media automation" (2.9K monthly searches)
Secondary: "automate Instagram posts" (1.2K monthly searches)
Long-tail: "how to automate social media content creation" (590 searches)
Question: "how long does it take to create social media content" (210 searches)
LLM-friendly: "AI content generation time savings" (data-driven, citation-worthy)
```

### Step 2: Analyze Top-Ranking Content

**What to look for:**
1. **Content structure** - What headings do they use?
2. **Word count** - How detailed are they? (Aim for 2000-3000 words)
3. **Visual elements** - What images/diagrams do they include?
4. **Schema markup** - Do they have FAQ or HowTo schemas?
5. **Data & stats** - What specific numbers do they cite?

**LLM Citation Analysis:**
Ask ChatGPT/Claude: "What would make you cite this article?"
Look for:
- Clear, definitive statements
- Specific numbers and comparisons
- Step-by-step processes
- Tables with data
- Before/after examples

### Step 3: Create Content Outline

## Phase 2: Writing the Content (2-4 hours)

### Step 4: Create the Blog Post File

```bash
./scripts/create-blog-post.sh "your-slug" "Your Title"
```

### Step 5: Fill in Frontmatter (Critical for SEO)

**Title Optimization:**
```yaml
title: How to [Action] [Benefit] - [Specific Result]
# Good: "How to Create 30 Days of Social Content in 30 Minutes"
# Bad: "Social Media Tips"
```

**Description (150-160 characters):**
```yaml
description: >-
  [Action verb] [Primary keyword] in [timeframe]. [Key benefit] with [specific data]. [CTA].
# Example: "Generate 30 days of social content in 30 minutes using AI. Save 93.75% time vs manual creation. Step-by-step guide."
```

**Keywords (5-10):**
```yaml
keywords:
  - [primary keyword - exact match]
  - [secondary keyword - related term]
  - [long-tail keyword 1 - 3-5 words]
  - [long-tail keyword 2 - question-based]
  - [LSI keyword - semantically related]
  - [product/service name if relevant]
```

**Schema Type Selection:**
```yaml
# Choose based on content type:
schema: HowTo        # For step-by-step guides
schema: Article      # For informational content
schema: FAQPage      # If primarily Q&A format
schema: Review       # For product reviews
```

**FAQ Section (Critical for Featured Snippets):**
```yaml
faq:
  - q: How long does [process] take?
    a: >-
      [Specific answer with numbers in first sentence]. [Supporting detail]. [Example].
  - q: What are the benefits of [topic]?
    a: >-
      [List 3-5 specific benefits with data]. [ROI calculation if applicable].
  - q: How much does [solution] cost?
    a: >-
      [Price range or comparison]. [ROI breakdown]. [Value proposition].
```

**Steps (For HowTo Schema):**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup [Tool/Process]
    description: >-
      [What user accomplishes in this step]. [Time estimate]. [Required resources].
  - name: [Action Verb] [Object]
    description: >-
      [Clear instructions]. [Expected outcome]. [Validation method].
```

### Step 6: Write the Content

**Opening Section (Quick Answer):**
```markdown
## Quick Answer

[Primary keyword] can [achieve result] in [timeframe] compared to [alternative timeframe] manually. This guide shows the exact [number]-step process: [step 1] ([time]), [step 2] ([time]), [step 3] ([time]).

**Why this works:**
- Direct answer to main query (LLM citation magnet)
- Includes primary keyword naturally
- Provides specific numbers
- Sets clear expectations
```

**Body Content Best Practices:**

1. **Use H2/H3 hierarchy properly**
   ```markdown
   ## Major Section (H2) - Include keyword variants
   ### Subsection (H3) - More specific
   #### Detail (H4) - Rarely needed
   ```

2. **Include data tables**
   ```markdown
   | Metric | Value | Source |
   |--------|-------|--------|
   | Average time saved | 93.75% | Internal study |
   | Cost reduction | $375/month | Case study |
   ```

3. **Add code examples**
   ````markdown
   ```javascript
   // Real, working code example
   const result = await generateContent({
     brand: 'EcoStyle',
     posts: 30,
     tone: 'friendly'
   })
   ```
   ````

4. **Use blockquotes for emphasis**
   ```markdown
   > **Key insight:** 93% of teams report time savings of 3+ hours per week after implementing AI content generation.
   ```

5. **Structured lists with bold labels**
   ```markdown
   **What you need:**
   - **Brand guidelines** - PDF or doc format
   - **Example posts** - 5-10 high-performing posts
   - **Tone preferences** - Friendly, professional, or casual
   ```

6. **Include real examples**
   ```markdown
   **Example prompt:**
   ```
   Create 30 Instagram posts for sustainable fashion brand targeting women 25-45
   with friendly, inspiring tone that highlight eco-friendly materials and artisan stories.
   Include captions (150-200 chars), 5-7 hashtags, posting schedule.
   ```
   ```

### Step 7: Optimize for LLM Citations

**What makes content citation-worthy:**

1. **Clear, definitive statements**
   ```markdown
   ❌ "AI tools can help save time"
   ✅ "AI tools reduce content creation time by 93.75%, from 8 hours to 30 minutes per month"
   ```

2. **Structured data**
   ```markdown
   ## Time Savings Breakdown

   | Task | Manual | AI-Assisted | Time Saved |
   |------|--------|-------------|------------|
   | Brainstorming | 1 hour | 5 minutes | 55 min |
   | Writing | 3 hours | 10 minutes | 2h 50m |
   | Editing | 1.5 hours | 10 minutes | 1h 20m |
   | **Total** | **5.5 hours** | **25 minutes** | **5h 5m** |
   ```

3. **Step-by-step processes**
   ```markdown
   ### 1. Setup Your Brand Voice (5 minutes)

   **Required:**
   - Brand guidelines document
   - 5-10 example posts

   **Process:**
   1. Upload guidelines → Platform
   2. Add example posts → Training
   3. Configure tone → Settings

   **Validation:**
   - Preview generated post
   - Check tone alignment
   - Adjust if needed
   ```

4. **Comparative analysis**
   ```markdown
   ## AI vs Manual Content Creation

   **Manual approach:**
   - 8 hours per week
   - $400 monthly cost (at $50/hr)
   - 30 posts per month
   - Inconsistent quality

   **AI-assisted approach:**
   - 30 minutes per week
   - $25 monthly cost
   - 30-40 posts per month
   - Consistent brand voice

   **Result: 16x faster, $375 saved monthly**
   ```

## Phase 3: Image Generation (15-30 minutes)

### Step 8: Generate AI Images

**Process:**

1. **Save your MDX file** (must have content in sections)

2. **Open the pipeline dashboard:**
   ```

     - **Inset**: Standard content (default)
     - **Float-right**: Tips, notes, short sections
     - **Grid**: Comparisons, before/after

7. **Insert images into blog post**
   - Click "Insert Approved Images into Blog Post"
   - System automatically:
     - Creates backup of original file
     - Finds optimal insertion point (after intro paragraph, not heading!)
