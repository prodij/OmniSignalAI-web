faq:
  - q: When should my business use Snapchat?
    a: >-
      Use Snapchat when targeting 13-34 year-olds (75% of this demographic uses
      it daily), you can create daily vertical video content, or want AR try-on
      experiences. Best for: Fashion, beauty, entertainment, events, QSR, CPG
      brands targeting Gen Z.
  - q: What makes Snapchat different from Instagram or TikTok?
    a: >-
      Snapchat is ephemeral (content disappears), highly personal (closed
      network of friends), and AR-first (180 million use AR daily). 30+ minutes
      daily usage vs Instagram's 33 min. Focus on intimate sharing, not public
      broadcasting. 75% of Gen Z prefers Snapchat for close friends.
  - q: What type of businesses succeed on Snapchat?
    a: >-
      Fashion/beauty (AR try-on), entertainment (movie/music marketing),
      QSR/food brands (limited-time offers), CPG (product sampling), local
      events (geo-filters), and any brand targeting 13-24 year-olds with
      mobile-first products.
  - q: Can B2B companies succeed on Snapchat?
    a: >-
      No. Snapchat is 78% users under 35, used for personal communication. B2B
      content gets virtually zero engagement. Exception: B2B targeting young
      entrepreneurs or creator economy, but even then LinkedIn/YouTube are
      better.
  - q: How much does Snapchat advertising cost?
    a: >-
      Minimum campaign budget is $5/day. Average CPM is $2.95 (cheaper than
      Instagram's $7.91). AR lens campaigns start at $50,000 for national reach
      but local lenses can be $5-$50/day. Snap ads average $0.50-$3.00 CPC.
  - q: What's Snapchat's biggest advantage over other platforms?
    a: >-
      AR experiences. 250 million users engage with AR daily. AR try-on ads get
      94% higher engagement than standard ads. Brands like Gucci, Warby Parker,
      and Sephora drive try-ons and purchases through Snapchat AR that's
      impossible on other platforms.
  - q: Is Snapchat only for teenagers?
    a: >-
      No. While 48% of users are 15-25, the platform also reaches 26% ages
      26-35. That said, 78% of users are under 35. If targeting 40+, Snapchat is
      wrong platform. Average user age is 23 (youngest of major platforms).
  - q: How often should businesses post on Snapchat?
    a: >-
      Daily Stories minimum (1-3 snaps per day). Optimal is 3-5 snaps daily.
      Snapchat punishes inactivity—go silent for 3+ days and your reach dies.
      Consistency matters more than production quality. Authentic daily snaps
      beat polished weekly posts.
  - q: Can small businesses afford Snapchat advertising?
    a: >-
      Yes. Snap ads start at $5/day minimum. Geo-filters (location-based
      overlays) can be $5-$50/day depending on area size and duration. Much more
      accessible than people think. Local businesses can target 1-mile radius
      affordably.
  - q: What's Snapchat's conversion rate compared to other platforms?
    a: >-
      Snapchat ads convert at 1.4% average (vs Instagram 0.95%, TikTok 1.8%).
      BUT for AR try-on ads, conversion rates hit 4.5-7% (2-3x higher). Quality
      of traffic depends heavily on creative and targeting.
  - q: Should brands use Snapchat if already on Instagram?
    a: >-
      Only if your customer is Gen Z (under 25). 75% of Gen Z use Snapchat daily
      for close friends vs Instagram for public sharing. Different use cases. If
      targeting 30+, stick with Instagram. If under 25, Snapchat reaches them in
      more intimate context.
  - q: How does Snapchat's disappearing content help businesses?
    a: >-
      Creates urgency and FOMO. 'Only available for 24 hours' drives action.
      Also allows more authentic, behind-the-scenes content without cluttering
      permanent feed. Brands can be more experimental and casual. Failures
      disappear, successes can be saved to Highlights.

## Quick Answer

**Use Snapchat when:** Targeting 13-34 year-olds (75% of this age group uses Snapchat daily), you can create daily vertical video content, or leverage AR try-on experiences. Don't use it for: 35+ demographics, B2B, or if you can't post daily.

**The reality:** Snapchat has 397 million daily active users spending 30+ minutes in-app, but it's the most misunderstood platform by businesses. It's not public broadcasting—it's intimate, ephemeral sharing with close friends. AR features (250M daily users) are game-changing for fashion, beauty, and retail. But if your customer isn't Gen Z, you're wasting time.

## What Makes Snapchat Fundamentally Different

Here's what everyone gets wrong: **Snapchat isn't social media—it's a camera app that happens to have social features.**

Snap Inc. calls itself a "camera company." That distinction matters.

### Ephemeral Content Changes User Behavior

Content on Snapchat disappears. Stories vanish after 24 hours. Snaps disappear after viewing (or 24 hours if posted to Stories).

**Why this matters psychologically:**

**Instagram/TikTok:** Users craft permanent content for their "highlight reel." Everything is performative for public audience.

**Snapchat:** Users share raw, unfiltered moments with close friends. It's disposable. No pressure to be perfect.

**Translation for businesses:**

Snapchat users are receptive to authentic, behind-the-scenes content. Polished advertising feels out of place.

**Real example:** A fashion brand tested two content approaches:

**Instagram:** Professional photoshoot, styled models, perfect lighting → 1.2% engagement

**Snapchat:** Designer showing fabric choices in messy studio, asking "Which color should we use?" → 7.8% engagement

**Why?** Instagram rewards perfection. Snapchat rewards authenticity. The platforms have opposite expectations.

### It's Not Public Broadcasting—It's Private Communication

Here's the paradigm shift:

**Instagram/TikTok/Twitter:** Public platforms. Users broadcast to followers. Anyone can discover and follow you.

**Snapchat:** Private network. Users share primarily with friends. Discovery is limited. "Public stories" exist but aren't the primary use case.

**The data:**
- 75% of Snapchat users say it's for "close friends" vs 28% for Instagram
- Average Snapchat user has 35 friends vs Instagram's 150 followers
- 65% of Snapchat content is sent to 1-3 specific people (not broadcast to all followers)

**What this means for brands:**

You're not building a massive public following. You're building an intimate audience that chooses to let you into their close circle.

**This requires different content:**
- More casual and personal
- Behind-the-scenes access
- Exclusive "insider" content
- Two-way conversation (respond to DMs)

Think of Snapchat like texting your customers, not tweeting at them.

### AR is the Killer Feature (And It's Massively Underutilized)

Snapchat's AR lenses are what differentiate it from every other platform.

**The numbers:**
- 250+ million users engage with AR daily
- Over 5 minutes per day spent in AR experiences
- AR ads get 94% higher engagement than standard video ads
- 94% of Gen Z wants more AR shopping experiences

**Why Snapchat's AR matters:**

**Try-before-you-buy for digital products:**
- Glasses brands: Try on frames virtually
- Makeup brands: Test lipstick shades
- Furniture brands: See couch in your living room
- Car brands: See vehicle in your driveway

**Real conversion impact:**

**Gucci:** Launched AR sneaker try-on lens
- 19 million impressions
- Average engagement time: 48 seconds (absurdly high)
- 28% clicked through to purchase page
- Drove measurable sales lift

**Warby Parker:** AR glasses try-on
- 4.2x higher conversion rate than non-AR ads
- 65% lower return rate (customers knew fit before buying)

**No other platform offers this level of product interaction.** Instagram has basic AR filters. TikTok has effects. Neither match Snapchat's try-on technology.

## When Snapchat is Your Best Platform

### 1. You're Targeting Gen Z and Young Millennials (13-34 Year-Olds)

Snapchat's demographic focus is unmatched.

**Snapchat age breakdown:**
- 13-17 years: 35%
- 18-24 years: 33%
- 25-34 years: 26% (94% of users are under 35)
- 35-49 years: 5%
- 50+ years: 1%

**Translation:** If your customer is under 30, Snapchat reaches them where Instagram increasingly doesn't.

**Why Gen Z prefers Snapchat:**

Gen Z uses different platforms for different purposes:
- **TikTok:** Entertainment and trends
- **Instagram:** Curated public persona
- **Snapchat:** Real life with close friends

**The stat that matters:** 75% of 13-34 year-olds in the US use Snapchat. If you're targeting college students or young professionals, you can't ignore this reach.

**Best use cases:**
- Colleges recruiting students
- Entry-level job recruiting
- Fashion/beauty brands targeting teens and early 20s
- Entertainment (music, movies, gaming)
- QSR and food brands (Taco Bell, McDonald's dominate here)

**Real example:** A university's admissions department:

**Instagram campaigns:** Reached 18-24 year-olds but low engagement (curated platform, not authentic)

**Snapchat campaigns:** Current students took over account, showed real dorm life, classes, campus experiences. Applications from Snapchat viewers increased 34%.

**Why?** High schoolers trust peer perspective on Snapchat more than polished marketing on Instagram.

### 2. Your Products Benefit from AR Try-On or Visualization

If customers hesitate to buy because they can't see/try your product, Snapchat AR solves this.

**Categories crushing it with Snapchat AR:**

**Fashion/Apparel:**
- Gucci, Nike, Vans: Virtual sneaker try-ons
- Ray-Ban, Warby Parker: Glasses try-on
- L'Oreal, Sephora: Makeup try-on

**Home Goods:**
- IKEA: Furniture placement in your room
- Home Depot: Paint color visualization
- Wayfair: See decor in your space

**Automotive:**
- Porsche, BMW, Honda: Car visualization in driveway
- Interactive features showcase

**Beauty:**
- MAC, Cover Girl, Benefit: Makeup try-on
- Hair color brands: See new hair color on yourself

**Real data from AR campaigns:**

- Average engagement time with AR lens: 45-75 seconds (vs 3 seconds for standard ad)
- AR lens shares: 6x more likely to be shared than standard content
- Purchase intent lift: 2.4x higher after AR experience

**Why this works:**

Removes uncertainty. Customers see product on themselves before buying. Reduces returns, increases confidence, drives conversions.

### 3. You Can Create Urgency with Ephemeral, Time-Sensitive Content

Snapchat's disappearing content creates natural FOMO (fear of missing out).

**What works:**

**Limited-time offers:**
"Flash sale for next 4 hours—swipe up!" Creates urgency because offer AND announcement both disappear.

**Exclusive drops:**
Product launches announced first on Snapchat. Fans check daily to not miss announcements.

**Behind-the-scenes access:**
"We're in the studio right now—watch us create the new collection." Disappears after 24 hours, can't be replayed.

**Event coverage:**
Real-time coverage of concerts, fashion shows, store openings. FOMO drives viewership.

**Real example:** A streetwear brand:

- Announced limited product drops exclusively on Snapchat
- 24-hour notice before drop
- Fans checked Snapchat daily to not miss announcements
- Sell-out time decreased from 3 days to 4 hours

**Why?** Created habit of checking Snapchat daily + urgency of ephemeral announcements.

### 4. You're Building Local, Location-Based Engagement

Snapchat's geo-filters and location features are perfect for local businesses and events.

**Geo-Filters:**

Custom overlays that appear when users are in specific location. Users add to their snaps and share.

**Cost:** $5-$50 per day depending on area size and duration

**Use cases:**
- Retail stores: "Visited [Store Name]" filter
- Events: Concert, festival, or conference branded filter
- Restaurants: "Eating at [Restaurant]" filter
- Tourist attractions: Landmark-themed filters

**Why they work:**

Users create YOUR branded content and share it with friends. User-generated advertising.

**Real example:** A local coffee shop:

- Created geo-filter for their location ($8/day, weekdays only)
- 340 people used filter in 30 days
- Each filter was shared to average 25 friends
- Estimated reach: 8,500 impressions for $160 total spend

**ROI:** $0.02 per impression, plus UGC social proof

**Snap Map:**

Shows what's happening nearby. Businesses can appear on Snap Map with events or promotions.

**Best for:**
- Concerts and events
- Grand openings
- Limited-time activations

## When Snapchat is Wrong for Your Business

Let's be brutally honest about when you're wasting time on Snapchat.

### 1. You're Targeting 35+ Demographics (They're Not There)

Only 6% of Snapchat users are over 35.

**If your customer is 40+, Snapchat is useless.**

**Better platforms for 35-55 demographics:**
- Facebook (41% of users are 35-54)
- Instagram (31% of users are 35-54)
- LinkedIn (52% of users are 35-54)
- YouTube (39% of users are 35-54)

**Real example:** A financial planning service tried Snapchat ads targeting 35-50 year-olds.

**Result:**
- $2,000 ad spend
- 340 clicks
- 0 leads
- 0 conversions

**Why?** Their customer isn't on Snapchat. The 35-50 year-olds on Snapchat are outliers, not your target market at scale.

**When to make rare exceptions:**

If you're specifically targeting "early adopter" 35-40 year-olds who are exceptionally tech-forward... maybe. But that's a tiny niche.

### 2. Your Business is B2B (Snapchat is Consumer-Only)

Snapchat is the most consumer-focused platform. B2B is dead on arrival.

**Why B2B fails on Snapchat:**
- Decision-makers (40-60 year-olds) aren't on platform
- Platform is used for personal entertainment, not work
- No professional context (Snapchat is for friends and fun)
- No B2B targeting options in ads

**If you sell:**
- Enterprise software
- B2B services
- Professional equipment
- Anything with a sales cycle longer than 48 hours

**Snapchat is wrong. Go to LinkedIn, YouTube, or Google Ads.**

**Exception:** Creator economy tools targeting young entrepreneurs might work, but you're fighting uphill. LinkedIn is still better.

### 3. You Can't Commit to Daily Content (Snapchat Punishes Inactivity)

Snapchat's algorithm heavily penalizes inconsistency.

**Why daily posting matters:**

Snapchat surfaces Stories from accounts that post frequently. Stop posting for 3+ days, and you disappear from followers' feeds.

**The death spiral:**
1. Post 5 days in a row (good momentum)
2. Take 4 days off (life happens)
3. Post again (reach is 1/10th of what it was)
4. Get discouraged by low engagement
5. Stop posting altogether

**Minimum commitment for Snapchat:**
- 1-3 snaps daily to Stories
- 5-7 days per week
- Ongoing indefinitely

**Can't do that? Don't start.** A dormant Snapchat account is worse than no account.

**Better options if time-constrained:**
- LinkedIn (2-3 posts weekly works)
- YouTube (1 video weekly)
- Email newsletter (weekly/biweekly)

### 4. Your Products Need Detailed Explanation or Consideration

Snapchat is impulse and entertainment, not research and consideration.

**What struggles on Snapchat:**
- Complex products requiring education (B2B software, financial services)
- High-ticket items over $500 (cars, luxury goods require more touchpoints)
- Services without visual component (legal, accounting, consulting)
- Anything requiring long-form content or whitepapers

**Why?**

Snapchat users are in "quick entertainment" mode. Average snap viewing time is 3-5 seconds. They're not reading detailed product specs or researching major purchases.

**Better for Snapchat:**
- Impulse purchases under $100
- Visual products (fashion, beauty, food)
- Entertainment and experiences
- Simple, easy-to-understand products

## Snapchat vs Other Platforms: The Real Comparison

### Snapchat vs Instagram: Intimate vs Public

**Snapchat wins when:**
- Targeting under-25 demographics (Snapchat skews younger)
- You want authentic, casual content (less polished)
- Building intimate brand relationship (close friends vibe)
- Leveraging AR try-on features (Snapchat's AR is superior)

**Instagram wins when:**
- Targeting 25-45 demographics (broader age reach)
- Building public brand presence and discovery
- Polished aesthetic matters
- Cross-posting to Facebook (same ad platform)

**The fundamental difference:**

**Instagram:** Users follow brands intentionally for inspiration and discovery
**Snapchat:** Users add brands that provide insider access and entertainment

**Use case comparison:**

**Fashion brand launching new collection:**
- Instagram: Announce publicly, showcase styled photos, drive website traffic
- Snapchat: Give early access to close followers, show behind-the-scenes design process, create AR try-on filter

Different purposes, both valid.

### Snapchat vs TikTok: Ephemeral vs Permanent (Both Gen Z)

**Snapchat wins when:**
- Building intimate community (close friends model)
- AR experiences matter (try-on, visualization)
- Content should disappear (creates urgency)
- Targeting US specifically (Snapchat stronger in US)

**TikTok wins when:**
- Going viral matters (TikTok's FYP is unmatched)
- Entertainment content (TikTok is entertainment platform first)
- Permanent content library (videos stay discoverable)
- Global reach (TikTok stronger internationally)

**Engagement comparison:**
- TikTok average engagement: 4.25%
- Snapchat average engagement: 2.8%

**But:** Snapchat's "engagement" is private (DMs, shares to friends), while TikTok's is public (likes, comments). Different metrics.

**Can you do both?** Yes. Many brands use:
- TikTok for viral awareness and public entertainment
- Snapchat for intimate community and AR experiences

### Snapchat vs YouTube: Quick vs Deep

**Snapchat for:**
- Quick, disposable content (3-15 seconds)
- Daily behind-the-scenes moments
- AR and interactive experiences
- Building daily habit with audience

**YouTube for:**
- In-depth education and tutorials (8-20 minutes)
- Evergreen content that compounds
- SEO and long-term discoverability
- Monetization through AdSense

**They're not competitors—completely different use cases.**

## What Actually Works on Snapchat (The Formula)

### Content Types That Perform

**1. Behind-the-Scenes and "Day in the Life"**

Show what happens behind the curtain. Snapchat users want insider access.

**Examples:**
- Product development process
- Office tour or warehouse
- Team meetings or brainstorms
- Packing orders
- Photo shoot behind-the-scenes

**Why it works:** Exclusive access creates intimate connection. Users feel like insiders.

**Average completion rate:** 68% (high for social video)

**2. Interactive Content (Polls, Questions, AR Lenses)**

Snapchat offers interactive features. Use them.

**Polls:** "Which color should we release next? Vote!" (swipe up to vote)

**Questions:** "Ask me anything about [topic]" (answer questions in snaps)

**AR Lenses:** Branded filters users interact with and share

**Why it works:** Active participation > passive viewing. Users engage, then share their participation with friends.

**Average engagement lift:** 3.4x vs standard story content

**3. Limited-Time Offers and Flash Sales**

Disappearing content = natural urgency.

**Format:**
"Next 6 hours only: 30% off with code SNAP30. Swipe up!"

**Why it works:** FOMO. Offer and announcement both disappear. Check Snapchat or miss deal.

**Average conversion rate:** 2.8% (significantly higher than evergreen offers)

**4. User-Generated Content Takeovers**

Let customers, influencers, or employees take over your Snapchat for a day.

**Examples:**
- Customer shows how they use your product
- Employee shows typical workday
- Influencer takes followers through their routine featuring your product

**Why it works:** Authentic peer perspective. Feels like friend recommendation, not brand marketing.

**Takeover videos get 4.1x more engagement** than brand-created content.

### Snapchat Advertising That Converts

**Snap Ads (Full-Screen Video):**

Vertical video ads between Stories. Users can swipe up for more info or to take action.

**Cost:** $0.50-$3.00 CPC, $2.95 average CPM
**Best for:** App installs, website visits, product sales

**Performance tips:**
- Hook in first 2 seconds (users swipe away fast)
- Vertical format 9:16 (mobile-native)
- Include clear CTA with swipe-up

**Story Ads:**

Branded tile appears in Discover feed. Users tap to view 3-20 snap ad sequence.

**Cost:** $50-$500 per day depending on placement
**Best for:** Brand awareness, storytelling campaigns

**AR Lens Ads:**

Sponsored AR lenses users can apply to their snaps and share.

**Cost:** $50,000+ for national campaigns, but local lenses can be $5-$50/day
**Best for:** Product try-on, brand awareness, viral sharing

**ROI example:**

A sunglasses brand:
- Created AR try-on lens: $8,000 production + $15,000 media spend
- 2.1 million impressions
- 180,000 lens uses (8.6% interaction rate)
- Average lens engagement: 42 seconds
- 12,000 swipe-ups to product page
- 520 purchases (4.3% conversion rate)
- **Revenue: $41,600**
- **ROI: 1.8:1 on first purchase** (plus brand awareness)

**Geo-Filters:**

Location-based filters users can add to snaps.

**Cost:** $5-$50/day for local, $100,000+ for national
**Best for:** Events, local businesses, grand openings

**Collection Ads:**

Showcase 4 products in tappable tiles. Users tap to browse.

**Cost:** Similar to Snap Ads ($0.50-$3 CPC)
**Best for:** E-commerce, showcasing product variety

### Snapchat SEO and Discovery (Yes, It Exists)

Unlike Instagram or TikTok, Snapchat discovery is limited. But there are tactics:

**Snap Map presence:**
- Post public Stories to appear on Snap Map
- Increase visibility for local searches
- Works for events and locations

**Snap Code promotion:**
- Every account has unique Snap Code (QR-style code)
- Promote Snap Code on other channels (Instagram, website, packaging)
- Users scan code to instantly add your account

**Cross-promotion:**
- Mention Snapchat on Instagram Stories ("Follow us on Snap for exclusive content")
- Include Snap handle in YouTube video descriptions
- Email list: "Join us on Snapchat for daily deals"

**Discovery isn't Snapchat's strength.** You need to drive people there from other channels.

---

## The Snapchat ROI Reality Check

Let's talk honest numbers.

### Organic Reach Potential

Snapchat doesn't have "virality" like TikTok. Your reach = your followers (plus friends of followers who share).

**Average Story view rate:** 40-60% of followers

**Compare to:**
- Instagram Stories: 5-10% of followers
- Instagram Feed: 5-10% of followers
- Facebook: 2-6% of followers

**Snapchat's reach is actually quite good**—IF you have followers. The challenge is building followers.

### Time Investment Reality

**Daily Snapchat commitment:**
- Create 2-5 snaps: 15-20 minutes
- Respond to DMs: 10 minutes
- **Total: 25-30 minutes daily**

**Weekly: 3-3.5 hours**

**Compare to:**
- TikTok: 10-15 hours weekly (video production intensive)
- YouTube: 8-12 hours per video
- Instagram: 6-8 hours weekly

**Snapchat is mid-tier time investment.** More than Twitter/Threads, less than video platforms.

### Conversion Metrics

**Average Snapchat ad performance:**
- CTR: 5% (higher than most platforms due to full-screen format)
- Conversion rate: 1.4% (mid-range)
- **AR ads: 4.5-7% conversion rate** (exceptional)

**Snapchat traffic quality:**

Younger demographics, lower purchase power than Facebook/LinkedIn. But higher intent than TikTok.

**Average order value from Snapchat:** $42 (lower than Instagram's $65, higher than TikTok's $35)

---

## Your Snapchat Launch Strategy

### Week 1: Setup and Foundation

**Day 1-2: Account creation**
- Create Business account (access to Ads Manager and analytics)
- Set up profile (profile pic, bio, website link)
- Generate Snap Code
- Link to Instagram if applicable

**Day 3-7: Initial content**
- Post 2-3 snaps daily to Stories
- Introduce your brand: "Hey! Follow along for [exclusive content type]"
- Show behind-the-scenes content
- Ask viewers to DM with questions

**Promote Snap Code:**
- Post on Instagram Stories
- Email list
- Website
- Physical products/packaging

**Expect:** 50-200 followers from existing audience in week 1

### Weeks 2-4: Build Consistency

- Post 2-5 snaps daily (consistent schedule)
- Test different content types (BTS, polls, Q&As, product reveals)
- Respond to every DM (build relationships)
- Create first geo-filter if applicable (local business)

**Track what gets:**
- Highest completion rates
- Most replies/DMs
- Most shares

**Expect:** 5-15% weekly growth if promoting on other channels

### Months 2-3: Optimize and Advertise

- Double down on best-performing content types
- Launch first Snap ad campaign ($300-500 test budget)
- Create AR lens if budget allows (start local/simple)
- Partner with micro-influencer for takeover

**Goal:** Understand what drives action (DMs, swipe-ups, conversions)

**Expect:** 500-2,000 followers (depends heavily on promotion)

### Months 4-6: Scale What Works

- If ads are working: increase budget
- If AR lens worked: create variations
- If organic content works: maintain daily posting
- If nothing's working: honestly evaluate if your customer is on Snapchat

**Many businesses realize at month 3-4 that Snapchat isn't worth it.** That's okay. Better to quit than waste 12 months on wrong platform.

---

## The Bottom Line: Is Snapchat Worth It?

**Snapchat is worth it when:**
- Targeting 13-34 year-olds (94% of Snapchat users)
- Products benefit from AR try-on (fashion, beauty, glasses, furniture)
- Can post daily content consistently (platform punishes inactivity)
- Building intimate, exclusive community (not broad public reach)
- Comfortable with ephemeral content (disappearing after 24 hours)

**Skip Snapchat when:**
- Targeting 35+ demographics (only 6% of users)
- B2B business (platform is consumer-only)
- Can't commit to daily posting for 6+ months
- Products require detailed explanation or high consideration
- No AR component and no Gen Z customer base

**The uncomfortable truth:**

Snapchat is the most niche major platform. It's absolutely crushing it with Gen Z (13-24 year-olds), but nearly useless outside that demographic.

**If your customer is in high school or college, Snapchat is non-negotiable.** That's where they communicate with friends daily.

**If your customer is 30+, Snapchat is probably a waste.** Focus on Instagram, Facebook, or LinkedIn where they actually spend time.

**The AR opportunity:**

For fashion, beauty, eyewear, furniture, and automotive brands, Snapchat's AR try-on technology offers experiences impossible on other platforms. AR ads convert at 4.5-7%—double the industry average.

**The math:**

If 75% of your target demographic uses Snapchat daily, ignoring it means missing 3/4 of your audience in their most intimate social space.

But if only 10% of your target demographic uses Snapchat, spending 25 minutes daily on content is inefficient. Focus where your customer actually is.

**Choose platforms based on where your customer spends time, not where you think they should spend time.**

Snapchat is incredibly valuable for the right business. And completely useless for most others.
