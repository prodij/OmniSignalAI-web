faq:
  - q: >-
      How long does it take to set up business accounts on all social media
      platforms?
    a: >-
      Approximately 2-3 hours total to set up all major platforms (Instagram,
      Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest) if you have all
      required materials ready.
  - q: Do I need separate email addresses for each social media platform?
    a: >-
      No, you can use the same business email for all platforms. However, some
      businesses prefer separate emails for organization and security purposes.
  - q: Which social media platforms require a personal account first?
    a: >-
      Facebook and Pinterest business accounts must be linked to a personal
      account for security purposes. Instagram can be created fresh or converted
      from personal. Others can be created directly as business accounts.
  - q: Are business social media accounts free?
    a: >-
      Yes, all major platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok,
      YouTube, Pinterest) offer free business accounts. Paid features like
      verified badges or advertising are optional.
  - q: What documents do I need to create business social media accounts?
    a: >-
      Generally, you need: business email, phone number, business name, logo
      (recommended 400x400px minimum), cover/banner images, business
      description, and website URL. Some platforms may require business
      verification documents for enhanced features.
  - q: Can I manage multiple social media business accounts from one dashboard?
    a: >-
      Yes, tools like Hootsuite, Buffer, Sprout Social, and OmniSignalAI allow
      you to manage multiple platform accounts from a single dashboard.
  - q: Should I create accounts on all platforms at once?
    a: >-
      It's recommended to start with 2-3 platforms where your target audience is
      most active, then expand. Trying to manage all platforms simultaneously
      without resources can lead to inconsistent posting.
  - q: What's the difference between a business account and personal account?
    a: >-
      Business accounts get access to analytics, advertising tools, contact
      buttons, multiple managers, and professional features. Personal accounts
      are for individual use without business tools.
  - q: Can I convert my personal account to a business account later?
    a: >-
      Yes, most platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, TikTok) allow
      conversion from personal to business accounts. The process is reversible
      on most platforms.
  - q: How do I know which social media platforms my business needs?
    a: >-
      Choose platforms based on: (1) where your target audience spends time, (2)
      content type you can consistently create (video, images, articles), (3)
      your business goals (B2B = LinkedIn, Visual products =
      Instagram/Pinterest, Entertainment = TikTok).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Critical Setup Errors

#### ❌ Mistake #1: Inconsistent Branding

**The problem:**
- Different logos on different platforms
- Varying business names
- Inconsistent colors and messaging

**Why it hurts:**
- Reduces brand recognition by 60%
- Confuses customers ("Is this the real account?")
- Harder to cross-promote

**✅ Solution:**
- Use identical logo everywhere (same file, same dimensions)
- Keep business name exactly the same (or as close as platform allows)
- Save brand colors as hex codes, use consistently
- Write one master bio, adapt for character limits

#### ❌ Mistake #2: Incomplete Profiles

**The problem:**
- Missing contact information
- No website link
- Empty bio or generic description
- No profile/cover images

**Why it hurts:**
- 70% of users leave incomplete profiles immediately
- Can't contact you for business inquiries
- Looks unprofessional/abandoned
- Poor search visibility

**✅ Solution:**
Complete profile checklist:
- [ ] Profile photo uploaded and clear at all sizes
- [ ] Cover/banner image professional quality
- [ ] Bio filled to character limit with keywords
- [ ] Website URL with UTM tracking
- [ ] Contact information (email, phone, address if applicable)
- [ ] Business hours (if applicable)
- [ ] Category/industry selected
- [ ] Location added

#### ❌ Mistake #3: Wrong Account Type

**The problem:**
- Using personal account for business
- Choosing wrong business category
- Not enabling business features

**Why it hurts:**
- No access to analytics (can't measure ROI)
- No advertising options
- Can't add multiple managers
- Limited professional features

**✅ Solution:**
| Platform | Correct Account Type | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Instagram | Business or Creator | Settings → Account → Check "Switch Account Type" |
| Facebook | Business Page (not profile) | Page has "Like" button, not "Add Friend" |
| LinkedIn | Company Page (not personal profile) | Separate from your personal account |
| TikTok | Business Account | Profile shows "Business" badge |
| Pinterest | Business Account | "Convert to business" in settings |

#### ❌ Mistake #4: Poor Image Quality

**The problem:**
- Low-resolution logos
- Pixelated cover images
- Wrong aspect ratios (stretched/cut off)

**Why it hurts:**
- Looks unprofessional instantly
- 75% less likely to follow low-quality profile
- Images represent 85% of first impression

**✅ Solution:**
Upload specifications:

| Platform | Profile Image | Cover/Banner | Notes |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| **Instagram** | 320x320px (displays at 110px) | N/A | Square, centered |
| **Facebook** | 170x170px (displays at 170px) | 820x312px | Profile appears on banner |
| **LinkedIn** | 300x300px | 1128x191px | White/transparent background best |
| **Twitter/X** | 400x400px | 1500x500px | Center of header image most important |
| **TikTok** | 200x200px | N/A | Circular crop |
| **YouTube** | 800x800px | 2560x1440px (safe: 1546x423px) | Banner varies by device |

**Pro tip:** Create images at 2x size, then downscale for sharper display on retina screens

#### ❌ Mistake #5: No Content Ready

**The problem:**
- Set up accounts then don't post for weeks
- First post is "Hello, we're new here!"
- Inconsistent posting schedule

**Why it hurts:**
- Algorithm penalizes inactive accounts
- Visitors see empty profile and leave
- Waste of setup effort

**✅ Solution:**
**Before going live:**
- [ ] Prepare 10-15 posts (scheduled across 2-3 weeks)

### Should I use my personal account or create a new one?

**Create separate business account if:**

- You plan to run ads
- You need multiple team members to manage
- You want access to analytics
- You want professional credibility

**Can use personal account if:**

- You're just starting to test the platform

**Platforms that allow conversion:**
- Instagram: Personal → Business (reversible)
- Facebook: Must create separate Page
- Pinterest: Personal → Business (reversible)
- TikTok: Personal → Business (reversible)

### What if my desired username is taken?

**Solutions in order:**

1. **Add location:** @yourbrand_NYC
2. **Add "official":** @officialyourbrand
3. **Add business type:** @yourbrandstudio
4. **Use "get" prefix:** @getyourbrand
5. **Add "co" or "inc":** @yourbrandco

**Don't:**
- Add random numbers (@yourbrand1234)
- Use underscores excessively (@your_brand_name_here)
- Misspell your brand name

**Pro tip:** Use namecheckr.com to check username availability across all platforms before deciding

### Can I run ads without a business account?

**No** - all platforms require business account features to run ads:

- Facebook/Instagram: Need Business Page
- LinkedIn: Need Company Page
- Twitter/X: Any account can advertise, but Professional accounts get better features
- TikTok: Need Business Account for TikTok Ads Manager
- YouTube: Can advertise through Google Ads with any account
- Pinterest: Need Business Account for Pinterest Ads

### How often should I post on each platform?

**Recommended posting frequency:**

| Platform | Minimum | Optimal | Maximum |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Instagram** | 3/week | 5-7/week | 2/day |
| **Facebook** | 3/week | 5/week | 1-2/day |
| **LinkedIn** | 2/week | 3-5/week | 1/day |
| **Twitter/X** | 3/day | 5-10/day | 20/day |
| **TikTok** | 3/week | 1/day | 3/day |
| **YouTube** | 1/week | 2-3/week | 1/day |
| **Pinterest** | 5/week | 1-2/day | 5/day |

**Reality check:**
- Most businesses can't maintain optimal frequency manually
- Solution: Use scheduling tools or OmniSignalAI to generate content in batches
- Start with minimum frequency, increase as you build systems

### What's the difference between business and creator accounts?

**On Instagram and TikTok, you can choose:**

**Business Account:**
- Access to advertising
- Shopping features (sell products)
- Contact buttons (call, email, directions)
- Category displayed (Restaurant, Retail, etc.)
- **Limitation:** Reduced music library on TikTok

**Creator Account:**
- Focus on content creation
- Access to Creator Studio
- More flexible category options
- Full music library on TikTok
- DM filtering and message controls
- **Limitation:** No direct selling features

**Which to choose:**
- **Business:** If you sell products/services directly
- **Creator:** If you're influencer, blogger, or content-focused

### Can I connect all my social media accounts?

**Directly connected:**
- ✅ Facebook + Instagram (owned by Meta, full integration)
- ✅ YouTube + Google My Business (same Google account)

**Can link but not post across:**
- ⚠️ Instagram + Twitter (can share to Twitter from Instagram)
- ⚠️ Instagram + Facebook (can cross-post)
- ⚠️ YouTube + Twitter (can share links)

**Cannot directly connect:**
- ❌ TikTok + Instagram (different companies)
- ❌ LinkedIn + Facebook (different companies)
- ❌ Pinterest + any others (requires manual or tool)

**Best solution:** Use management tools
- OmniSignalAI connects all platforms
- Post once, publish everywhere (with platform-specific optimizations)
- Save 60-70% of posting time

### Do I need a business email for each platform?

**No**, you can use the same business email for all platforms.

**Pros of one email:**
- Easier to remember
- Centralized notifications
- Simpler management

**Cons of one email:**
- All notifications come to one place (can be overwhelming)
- Security risk if email is compromised

**Best practice:**
- Use business email (not personal)
- Set up filters/labels for each platform
- Enable 2FA on email account
- Consider separate email for ads accounts (if running paid campaigns)

### How long until I see results from social media?

**Realistic timeline:**

**Months 1-3: Foundation**
- Focus: Build presence, establish posting cadence
- Follower growth: 50-200 followers per platform
- Engagement: Low but growing
- ROI: Minimal direct sales, brand awareness building

**Months 4-6: Growth**
- Focus: Consistency, engagement, refining strategy
- Follower growth: 200-1000 followers per platform
- Engagement: 2-5% rate
- ROI: Starting to see inquiries and traffic

**Months 7-12: Traction**
- Focus: Optimization, scaling what works
- Follower growth: 1000-5000 followers per platform
- Engagement: 5-10% rate
- ROI: Measurable conversions, clear ROI

**Accelerate results:**
- Use paid ads (boosted posts start at $5/day)
- Post consistently (no gaps in schedule)
- Engage actively with followers and industry accounts
- Use tools like OmniSignalAI to maintain frequency

### Should I buy followers to look established?

**Absolutely not.** Here's why:

**Negative impacts:**
- 🚫 Fake followers don't engage (destroys your engagement rate)
- 🚫 Algorithms penalize low engagement (reduces real reach)
- 🚫 Obvious to anyone who looks (hurts credibility)
- 🚫 Violates platform terms (risk account suspension)
- 🚫 Wastes ad budget (you're targeting bots)

**Better strategies:**
1. **Collaborate:** Partner with complementary brands for shoutouts
2. **Contests:** Run giveaways requiring follow + tag friends
3. **Cross-promote:** Share social accounts on email, website, other platforms
4. **Engage authentically:** Comment on 20 posts daily in your niche
5. **Paid ads:** Use small budget for awareness (targets real people)

**Starting from zero is fine:**
- Everyone starts with 0 followers
- Authentic growth is respected
- 1000 engaged followers > 10,000 fake followers
