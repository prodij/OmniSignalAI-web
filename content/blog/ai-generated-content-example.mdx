## This is a PageBuilder Example

This blog post was created using the new PageBuilder system. Instead of writing raw HTML or Markdown, the page structure is defined in the frontmatter using a JSON-based block system.

The PageBuilder renders these blocks into React components from our design system, ensuring consistency and enabling AI agents to create beautiful, functional pages without writing code.

## Traditional Markdown Still Works

You can include traditional Markdown content alongside PageBuilder blocks. This gives you the flexibility to combine structured component-based sections with freeform content.

This hybrid approach is perfect for AI agents that need to generate both structured layouts and narrative content.

## Try It Yourself

Check out the `lib/ai-agent-sdk/` documentation to learn how to use the AI Agent SDK to create your own PageBuilder pages programmatically!
