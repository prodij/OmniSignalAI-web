## üìä Overview: What We're Building

### The Vision
Transform OmniSignalAI-web from a **static marketing website** into a **dual-purpose cockpit**:

1. **Public Website** (unchanged for visitors)
   - Marketing homepage with sections
   - Blog (static MDX files OR API content)
   - Pricing, about, contact pages

2. **Internal Cockpit** (new for marketing team)
   - Dashboard to manage content
   - AI-powered content generation wizard
   - Publish/edit/delete workflows
   - Lead management

### The Context
- **Backend (omnidraft):** Building AI blog generation pipeline in parallel
- **Frontend (OmniSignalAI-web):** Building cockpit UI and integration
- **Coordination Required:** We're working on different timelines but need to integrate

## üìã Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### PHASE 0: Foundation (1-2 sessions, ~4-6 hours)

#### What We Build
1. Install Supabase + axios dependencies
2. Configure environment variables
3. Create Supabase client (client + server)
4. Build authenticated API client with JWT interceptor
5. Create service layer (blog, auth services)
6. Write integration tests

#### Backend Dependencies
- ‚úÖ **NONE** - uses existing endpoints

#### Deliverables
- Can authenticate with Supabase
- Can fetch blog posts from API
- API client auto-refreshes tokens on 401
- All integration tests pass

#### Risk Level: üü¢ LOW
- All required endpoints exist
- No coordination needed
- Can start immediately

---

### PHASE 1: Auth & Dual Content (2-3 sessions, ~6-9 hours)

#### What We Build
1. Login page (magic link UI)
2. Auth callback route
3. Auth middleware (protect /dashboard)
4. Dual content resolver (file OR API)
5. Update blog pages to use resolver
6. Integration tests

#### Backend Dependencies
- ‚úÖ Auth endpoints (ready)
- ‚úÖ Blog CRUD endpoints (ready)

#### How Dual Content Works
```typescript
// 1. Unauthenticated user visits /blog
//    ‚Üí Shows static MDX files

// 2. Authenticated user visits /blog
//    ‚Üí Tries API first, falls back to static if error

// 3. Feature flag controls behavior
//    ‚Üí NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_API_CONTENT=true
```

#### Deliverables
- Working login flow
- Protected dashboard route
- Blog shows API content when authenticated
- Blog shows static content when not authenticated
- No breaking changes to public site

#### Risk Level: üü¢ LOW
- All endpoints exist
- Fallback ensures resilience
- Public site unaffected

---

### PHASE 2: Dashboard & Content Wizard (3-4 sessions, ~9-12 hours)

#### What We Build
1. Dashboard layout with navigation
2. Content manager (list, publish, delete)
3. AI content wizard (form ‚Üí generate ‚Üí save)
4. Post editor
5. Integration tests

#### Backend Dependencies
- ‚úÖ Blog CRUD (ready) - for manager
- üöß AI Pipeline (Week 4-6) - for wizard

#### The Coordination Challenge
**The wizard needs AI generation endpoint:**
- Backend building: `/api/v1/blog/generate` (Week 4-6)
- Frontend needs: AI wizard UI (Phase 2)

**Solution: Fallback Strategy**
```typescript
// Option 1: Build with fallback (recommended)
const generateContent = async (params) => {
  if (BACKEND_PIPELINE_READY) {
    // Use backend multi-agent pipeline
    return await blogService.generateContentPipeline(params)
  } else {
    // Fallback: direct AI call (works now)
    return await aiService.generateText(params)
  }
}

// Option 2: Wait for backend (delays 4-6 weeks)
```

#### Deliverables
- Dashboard with stats
- Content table with publish/delete actions
- AI wizard generates content (fallback or real)
- Post editor saves changes
- All tests pass

#### Risk Level: üü° MEDIUM
- Wizard needs coordination on AI endpoint
- Can use fallback to unblock
- Need to swap implementation later

---

### PHASE 3: Lead Forms (1 session, ~2-3 hours)

#### What We Build
1. Update contact forms to POST to `/api/v1/leads`
2. Form validation
3. Success states

#### Backend Dependencies
- ‚úÖ Leads endpoint (ready)

#### Deliverables
- Contact forms submit to backend
- Lead data captured in omnidraft
- Success/error handling

#### Risk Level: üü¢ LOW
- Endpoint exists
- Simple integration
- No coordination needed

---

### FUTURE: Review Workflows (After Phase 3)

#### What Backend Builds (Week 7-9)
- Human-in-the-loop review system
- Approve/reject workflows
- Review queue

#### What Frontend Builds
- Review queue dashboard
- Review interface (side-by-side comparison)
- Approval/rejection UI
- Real-time notifications

#### Coordination Required
- WebSocket events schema
- Review status state machine
- UI/UX alignment

#### Timeline
- Start after Phase 3 complete
- Depends on backend Week 7-9 delivery

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Concerns

### 1. Fallback Implementation Work
**Concern:** Building wizard twice (fallback + real)
**Reality:** Fallback is simple, swap is minimal
```typescript
// Fallback (1 hour)
const generate = () => aiService.generateText(params)

// Swap to real (30 minutes)
const generate = () => blogService.generatePipeline(params)
```

### 2. Coordination Overhead
**Concern:** Weekly syncs might slow us down
**Reality:** 1 hour/week prevents days of rework

### 3. Testing Complexity
**Concern:** Testing dual content system is complex
**Reality:** Clear resolver pattern makes it testable

### 4. Schema Evolution
**Concern:** Backend schema changes break frontend
**Reality:** Versioning + feature flags protect us
